# TravelGuide

# Introduction 

# Motivation
In the last few years, sharing economy platforms have become popular in different fields, especially
in hospitality. These platforms enable cutting down the middle man in the supply chain process
and making transactions directly between the supplier and customer (peer-to-peer) that results in
providing products/services with low prices and convenience, that a reason behind the popularity
of these platforms. Airbnb is one of the popular sharing economy platforms that operate in more
than 200 countries. It allows millions of people (hosts) to invest in unused spaces by renting
them to millions of guests. Airbnb reduces the cost of properties between 30% to 60% compared
to hotels. Furthermore, the customer can filter the properties based on the price range, location
and a wide range selection of property types (entire apartment, entire home, in-suite bedroom).
Moreover, Airbnb provides the user with more customization options enabling the user to find a
property that meets all the criteria that the user need. For example, the user could select a property
based on the host language, interest or property amenities. Furthermore, Airbnb’s revenue increases
year by year. In 2018, the total revenue of Airbnb was 3.6 billion U.S dollars which increased by
31% in the following year.

# Purpose
Even though the Airbnb platform provides helpful information about the property itself and its
host, it does not provide information about nearby places (caf´es, restaurants, public transportation,
activities) or information about how often crime occurs in the neighborhood of the property. This
information is important as it could strongly affect the user decision of selecting a place to stay.
This project aims to build a new web application that is going to solve these problems by creating
a more in-depth property exploratory experience. In particular, this system is called Travel Guide,
it would enable the users to analyze properties, but also venues within London, giving them more
historical information about those properties as well as being able to explore different activates
or venues that exist nearby. It would also provide overlies of information that allows the user to
have broader information about the city such as crime rates, information about useful locations
like embassies. In this way, the Travel Guide system will provide more effective information than
Airbnb does currently that help the users to decide where to stay.

# Hint: Data_Cleaning_py file is not an executable file. It was used to clean and process the data before using them in the project. However, this file shows the effort that pay in the early stages of the project as this stage consumed approximately one-third of the project time.
